# Conceal Node Guardian 

## About

Conceal Node Guardian is a process that monitors the `conceald` daemon. It is catching daemon errors, monitors the block count and, in case of an error, it restarts the daemon and notifies on Discord via web hook, sends an e-mail, or both.

It also has an ability to connect to a pool with other nodes for the purpose of infrastructure monitoring or running a remote node with fee listing.

```

### Precompiled binaries

Please refer to [installation page](INSTALL.md) for detailed instructions how to install the Guardian with precompiled binaries.

## Configuration

The Guardian can be configured manually by creating `config.json` file in the project's root directory or by using interactive setup (refer to [installation page](INSTALL.md) for instructions how to run interactive setup).

You can use [sample configuration](config.json.sample) and modify it for your needs.

**Description of configuration options:**

* **node**
  * args: The arguments that get appended to the monitored process.
  * path: The path of the process. If omited it uses the same path where the guardian is located
  * port: The port on which conceald is running
  * name: Name of the node. If omited it uses the hostname.
  * feeAddr: The CCX address on which the transaction fee will be sent in case of remote node.
  * bindAddr: The address on which you listen. 127.0.0.1 for localhost only. 0.0.0.0 for outside accesible node.
* **error**
  * **notify**
    * **discord**
      * url: the ulr of the Discord web hook, where the error reports are send.
    * **email**
      * **smtp**

## Running

Depending on how Guardian is installed, there are 2 ways to run it, with Node.js or by using precompiled binaries. In both cases, you can install it as a system service and run it that way too.

### Node.js

Navigate to project's folder and run `index.js` file:

```bash
$ cd conceal-guardian
$ node index.js
```
  
To run as a service you can use the build in service controls described on [installation page](https://github.com/ConcealNetwork/conceal-guardian/blob/master/SETUP.md). Or you can do it the manual way. On linux you can use **systemctl**
=======

### Running as a System Service

#### Linux

On Linux, you can use `Systemd` with following configuration:

```
[Unit]
Description=Node Guardian

[Service]
Type=simple
# Another Type option: forking
User=nodeguard
WorkingDirectory=/usr/bin
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node /path/to/guardian/index.js
Restart=always
RestartSec=3

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Edit the file accordingly and save it as `/etc/systemd/system/ccx-guardian.service`.

To enable the service and run it on startup, run:

```bash
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
$ sudo systemctl enable ccx-guardian.service
```

You can control system service with following commands:

```bash
# start
$ sudo systemctl start ccx-guardian

# stop
$ sudo systemctl stop ccx-guardian

# status
$ sudo systemctl status ccx-guardian

# print log
$ journalctl -e -u ccx-guardian.service

# reload configuration
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

#### macOS

On macOS, use `launchd` to configure service. Use following configuration:

```plist
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
  <dict>

    <key>Label</key>
    <string>conceal.guardian</string>

    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>

    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
      <string>/usr/local/bin/node</string>
      <string>/path/to/guardian/index.js</string>
    </array>

  </dict>
</plist>
```

Edit the file accordingly and save it as `~/Library/LaunchAgents/conceal.guardian.plist`.

Start it with:

```bash
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/conceal.guardian.plist
```

If you want to unload it, run:

```bash
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/conceal.guardian.plist
```

### Precompiled binaries

Please refer to [installation page](INSTALL.md) for detailed instructions how to run the Guardian with precompiled binaries.

## API

The Guardian has an option to run HTTP server providing some general info about the node.  
API serves a single endpoint - `/getInfo`.

Sample request:

```bash
# Assuming API port in config.json is set to 8000
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/getInfo
```

Sample response:
